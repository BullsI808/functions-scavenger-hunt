  //PART I

  //Function 1
  //Create a function that adds variables a and b, then divides them by 11.


  //Function 2
  //Create a function that will console.log a value of 18.


  //Function 3
  //Create a function that will console.log the last element of the array by accessing the value from the array.


  //Function 4
  //Create a function that can divide hours by quarters, then add 10 to that result.


  //Function 5
  //Create a function that will multiply the 2nd and 3rd element from the array, then subtract 5 from that result.


  //Function 6
  //Create a function that will subtract the number of car wheels from the number of spaceship wheels.


  //PART II

  //Function 7
  //Create a function and using a for loop, iterate through the array. In this loop, increment the count of the variable count.


  //Function 8
  //Create a function and using a for loop, iterate through the objectArray. In this loop, increment the count of the passengers for the 1st element in the objectArray.


  //Function 9
  //Create a function that adds the 1st and 6th element of the array.
